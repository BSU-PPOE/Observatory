# Observatory


## Our data repositories are under construction.

Our data consist of images in standard astronomy FITS format (both raw and calibrated, as well as calibration files for use with raw data).  Additional photometric information  (about how bright the stars in the images are and how they change over time) will become available for each set as we generate it on our end.  

## Data  

Below, you'll find a list of targets we have imaged with links to dates on which we imaged them.  Need some help getting started? [Follow this link to better understand our data and how we're listing it](https://github.com/BSU-PPOE/About-Our-Data#readme).
